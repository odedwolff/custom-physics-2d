"# custom-physics-2d" 



This is a prototype for developing physics for games bypassing Unity's Physics engine, in order to gain
More control and flexibility, and not be constrained by some of the very specific behaviour of Unity at times.
Some of the themes covered (present and future):

* collision of a bouncy (elastic) ball with hard object in different configurations
* friction between objects
